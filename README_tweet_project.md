# Predicting Tweet Popularity

This project uses logistic regression and sentiment analysis to predict whether a tweet will receive high engagement.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `tweet_model.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the full data pipeline and model
- `data/tweets.csv` â€“ Sample dataset of tweets
- `visuals/accuracy.png` â€“ Model performance visualization

## ðŸ§  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, VADER Sentiment
- Logistic Regression
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ§ª Key Steps
1. Cleaned and merged multiple tweet datasets (10K+ entries)
2. Engineered features: hashtag count, sentiment score, user influence
3. Trained logistic regression model to classify engagement
4. Evaluated model with 85% accuracy

## ðŸ“Š Insights
- Positive sentiment and use of specific hashtags increase engagement probability
- User follower count was a significant predictor

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Integrate Twitter API for real-time predictions
- Explore NLP-based classification with transformers
